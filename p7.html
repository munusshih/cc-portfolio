        Description
      </h1>

      <p>
        In this game, you will be playing young Munus in his 18. In the
        beginning, you have just become a college student majoring in
        Engineering, but you always have this passion for design. In the game,
        You have to choose between going to classes, preparing for exams or
        doing the design you love. If you choose design over classes, your GPA
        is gonna drop and eventually be expelled. If you choose classes over
        design, you will be depressed. So, Balancing is King.

        <br /><br />
        The concept behind the game is to represent the difficulty of handling
        multiple aspects of one's life at the same time, and how doing the
        things you love is not enough, but balancing over multiple duty tasks,
        passion projects are the only way to survive.
      </p>

      <p>
        The original concept was to make a narrative game with multiple options
        to choose from, but the format or experience of playing such game
        doesn't really capture that difficulty and urgency of choosing and
        balancing in one's life.

      <p>
        In the end I took inspiration from games like Space Invader that would
        force the player to response immediately to the options and could see
        the gpa/depression number increases or decreases. <br / > Having so
        friends tested the game for me, I found out that the interface right now
        is not very tuitive. I might have to find a more graphical way to
        visualize the gpa/depression number and make it easier for the users to
        make further actions.

      <p>
        Making a game is so hard! It is a holisitc kind of user experience.
        There are still so many things to do after making a greybox, and the art
        of the game is KING.
        <br />
        I ran out of time but I might add more levels to the game or add music
        to it in the future. I learned a lot about games and definitely reflect
        hard on the games I have played during my process. It was a
        thought-provoking experience.
