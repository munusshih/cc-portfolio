        Description
      </h1>

      <p>
        I have been so busy for the past week, so I've decided to collect data
        about my weekly schedule. What I was doing in a certain time slot and
        how long have I been doing it.
      </p>

      <p>
        I started out searching for different data visualization types and ended
        up discovering this website called data visualization project that has a
        great variety of different data types. I also wanted to combine two
        different data viz methods: a timeline that represents when and what I
        was doing; stacked bar chart that totals the number of hours that I have
        been working.
      </p>
      <br />

          width="400px"

          alt="Stacked Bar Chart"
          width="400px"
        />
      </div>
      <p>
        I also drew inspiration from Candlestick and other data types. It feels
        rewarding to combine different types of data viz and create your own.

      <p>
        It is interesting to see how by utilizing interactivity, the audience
        can have a better understanding of the data through the act of playing.
        It is also fascinating to think of how data can literally be anything as
        long as it could be quantitated or qualitated. Through different methods
        of mapping, designers can really tell any story with data visualization.
