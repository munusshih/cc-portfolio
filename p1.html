        Description
      </h1>

      <p>
        It is a Burgundy color water cup with a straw attached. The shape and
        size of it is very close to the venti cup size at Starbucks. It’s s
        metal cup but the lid and the straw are plastic. The lid is half
        transparent and you can see through. The straw is straight and it’s a
        lighter shade of red compare to the cup itself. The top of the cup is
        slightly wider compare to the bottom. There is no text or graphic on the
        cup.

        The description did not provide any image, pattern details about the cup
        (or just like they said, there is no any), so I've decided to design the
        cup on my own. Though it is hard to make the cup metal, I can generate a
        bunch of cups using code and have them perform the metallic sounds to
        mimic what a metallic cup must sound like when being tapped on.

        Code is very powerful especially at generating something repetitive but
        with a slightly different variations. I could also use code to generate
        something that is responsive, interactive to make the lost items more
        alive. Word descriptions are very limited when it comes to describe a
        physical object, and it is even harder to use code to micmic that
        because of the limitation. But I think it's a new way of expressing
        something in literacy, and there are pros and cons of doing that. As
        designers, our job is to utilize the tools at their bests. Make codes
        are friends.
