        Description
      </h1>

      <p>
        As a people of Hakka, I have always wanted to create works that reflect
        my background and the rich diverse pattern of my culture. The red and
        green Hakka flower cloth and the big peony flowers represent wealth and
        joy; in recent years, they have become the representative of Hakka
        culture.
        <br /><br />
        However, the people who make traditional Hakka clothing industry,
        believe that Hakka flower cloth actually originated from Japan. During
        the Japanese colonialization in Taiwan, the flower cloth became popular.
        Most of the cultures rejected to continue using this pattern by the end
        of colonialization, except the Hakka people. So afterward, the flower
        cloth was seen as a symbol of Hakka, and the flower cloth was regarded
        as a representative of Hakka's colonialized history.

      <p>
        I started out illustrating the patterns in Adobe illustrator, there is
        actually a specific technic used to draw the flowers to have it being
        considered as a Hakka Pattern. Which makes my work easier since I only
        have to simply reference it.

        I later export them into svg and import them using the same svg to p5
        tool that I used in the previous assignment. I made 5 different kinds of
        leaves and 4 different kinds of flowers, and used random function for
        determining their positions, rotated degrees and scales.

        Reflection

      <p>
        Though it's less of an "optical illusion" work that was mentioned in the
        assignment requirment. I am actually really impressed with my final
        outcome! This is the first time I have incorporate my own culture into
        my work using codes, and I really think the outcome looks fresh and new.
        I also really enjoyed reading and researching history about my own
        culture, and was surprised that I have never learned about the
        colonialized history of the pattern before.
        <br /><br />
        The experience was both visually eye-opening and also mentally to me.
