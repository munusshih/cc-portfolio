      <h1>
        Description
      </h1>

      <p>
        It is a consentful interface built on top of my experimental camera.
      </p>

      <!-- 4. reflection -->
      <h1>
        Design Process
      </h1>

      <p>
        The idea is to use "F.R.I.E.S." model to build a consentful interface
        for my experimental camera.
      </p>
      <br />

      <div class="fullwidth">
        <img
          src="https://cdn.glitch.me/cbb6d0d6-2bbb-4a1a-aeca-3f2d3a316805%2FScreen%20Shot%202021-11-19%20at%206.40.19%20PM.png?v=1638336446863"
        />
      </div>

      <p>
        The three things I can think of that needs the consent is "the access to
        camera", "the access to mouseX, mouseY" and the consent to even use this
        sketch. I designed these three consents in different format. I will
        elaborate how I use the FRIES model to design the interface below.
      </p>
      <br />
      <h3>
        Freely Given
      </h3>

      <br />
      <p>
        In order to make the user feels like they are not being forced to
        consent but rather it's an option for them. I also design the front
        animated page of the interface. So users who do not want their camera to
        be accessed can also look at the animated front page without being
        bored.
      </p>
      <br />
      <h3>
        Reversible, Enthusiastic, Informed
      </h3>

      <br />
      <p>
        Users can check the box themselves to consent to the access of their
        camera or mouse data. They can always uncheck the box to reverse the
        action when they are no longer enthusiastic.
      </p>
      <br />
      <h3>
        Specific
      </h3>
      <br />
      <p>
        The two checkbox has vey distinct instruction. Instead of saying
        "Consent to access the mouse", I used a more specific language "Consent
        to Access the XY Position of Mouse" to inform the user.
      </p>

        Reflection
      </h1>

      <p>
        I love the idea of consentful interface. I think it is very powerful and
        is something that seperate us from "engineers" who would simply code the
        interface out.
        <br />
        I definitely want to dive more into the idea of that and learn how
        designers can build better interface using these humanistic knowledges.
