        Description
      </h1>

      <p>
        Despite looking like a normal clock at first glance, it actually expands
        into a multi-dimensional clock. <br /><br />I came from Taiwan where it
        has 12 hours difference from New York, so if you compare the clock used
        in Taiwan with the clock used in New York, they are identical. And it
        sort of gives you that eery feeling that the time is synchronous. Yet it
        is not, and with that 12 hours difference, it's hard to video chat with
        my friends and family in taiwan, because when it's daytime here, it's
        midnight there. I wanted to address this strange feeling of synchronous
        and unsynchronous both at once using an expandable clock.

      <p>
        At first glance, you might feel like, oh it's a simple clock. Like when
        you see how identical clocks in Taiwan are to the clocks in New York.
        But when you click on it, it expands into this complex, multi-layers of
        clocks that grants you knowledge in what they might be doing right now
        and what you're supposed to do.

        <br /><br />It also guides you through the possible time of video
        chatting with your friends and family. It is definitely hard to read,
        and it's indeed inhuman and unintuitive, but that's exactly what I feel
        like when I try to understand the 12 hr difference we have. If you want
        to, you could always just release the mouse and synchronize it again
        back to its simple form. <br /><br />

        ></iframe>

        Before making this clock, I actually made another clock that only uses
        particles that rotate and create different shapes throughout the day.
        That kind of inspires me to make something as complex but functional,
        and address the topic in a more personal way. Making my own clock. After
        all, time is subjective, and it takes time to learn how to read this
        clock, just as all the clocks.

        Reflection
      </h1>

      <p>
        Time is a difficult thing to design for. Not only because that it is
        ever-changing, but also because that it is so relatable that everyone
        has their own personal experience to it. Through the process of making
        this clock, I realized that although we often view time as objective, it
        is fairly personal and private.
        <br /><br />
        Whether it is social, cultural or political, we all cannot escape from
        being with time, contexualizing with time and interpret time by
        ourselves. The most challenging part of making this piece might be that
        - since there are already so many great works about time that exist,
        what else could have been done?
