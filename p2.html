      <p>
        I personally love to draw faces, and this is my first attempt to
        transform my drawing into a random generator. This piece of work is B&W
        because I wanted the viewers to notice that squiggly, hand-drawn style
        in my lines using random functions.
        <br /><br />Not only generating the faces using the random function but
        also their names are generated randomly from a list of thousand unisex
        names on the internet. Every one of them generated from the random
        function has a unique name and is part of the new school, thus the font
        I used here is our customized new school font. <br /><br />They would
        introduce themselves every time you create them.

        I love to sketch, but I didn't spend much time on drafting this time. I
        was trying to implement the idea of "coding as painting", and just get
        my hands on the coding process without thinking too much. Change the
        concept as I'm coding new things, get into 'the zone'.
        <br /><br />
        I first started with the face, and gradually add more features to it.
        Before finishing the whole thing, I feel like there's something missing.
        What else do we usually think of when we think of someone's face? What
        is something that makes this face unique among all the faces we've seen.
        Then, ding dong! The idea of generating their names randomly popped into
        my head, and I soon found this library called 'p5.speech' to take my
        idea to the next level.
        <br /><br />
        Not only did I successfully pulled their names from a list of a thousand
        unisex names, but I also use p5.speech to randomly assign them their
        speech pitch, speech rate, and greeting words.
        <br /><br />
        <div class="coding">
          sayer.setLang("es-US"); 
          <br>
          sayer.setPitch(random(0.01, 2));
          <br>
          sayer.setRate(random(1.2, 1.5));

        Reflection
      </h1>

      <p>
        Some people would claim that drawing on paper with pen versus drawing
        with code on screen is fundamentally the same if you excludes the
        difference in medium. Yet I found out that the whole process of drawing,
        the thinking behind it as well as the possibilities are nothing alike to
        be honest. Here I quote the words professor Justin Bakse said about why
        he loves coding, "these things are alive".
        <br /><br />
        I also reflect heavily through the process of image-making on what
        xinxin said in the lecture video, "randomness is embeded in our
        culture". The concept behind a face generator is to parametized faces,
        extract features from them, flatten them and mapping into another face.
        If the process of drawing faces is a humanistic approach to our ideas of
        faces, then the process of coding one is a mechanic - even A.I. oriented
        - process of generating.
