    <marquee scrollamount="10">You are looking at Munus' website, this is so embarrasing and private, so I guess we are best friends now. 
    The weather today is very nice.....needless to say. Have you ever wondered why New York City always smells like shit? 
    I think the mask helps though. OK I have a weird question, but would you like to go to a picnic together? Do you wanna know a fun fact? 
      I'm taking both Data Visualization & Info Aesthetics + Creative Coding: Algorithmic Prints at the same time, two electives, can you imagine it?
      It's draining my creativities... but I will keep hoilding on... ok seriously I have told you everything, and you really shouldn't be looking at the computer screen for such a long time... dude....</marquee>
