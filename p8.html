        The idea is to create a kaleidoscope that would change the way we
        percieve ourselves.

        I personally love kaleidoscope so much that it's one of my favorite toys
        growing up. Below are several screenshots I took when playing with it.

        I love how it is changing the way we perceive reality. I remembered when
        I was little, I was amazed by how things seemed so different from the
        lens and how it transform ordinary life objects into mesmerizing
        combinations of shapes and colors.
        <br />Thus, I tried to recreate a kaleidoscope that is both interactive
        yet also changes with frameCount. It is constantly rotating and scaling,
        creating infinite amounts of variations.

        I am very happy with the result. This is exactly what I wanted and even
        more fun.
        <br />
        I eventually play with it for many hours (haha), and I even fixed the
        bug so it would work across different devices (even work on mobile!). I
        really hope the kaleidoscope would make some people's day and remind
        them what it's like to be a kid and always get excited to learn new
        things, see things with fresh eyes.
